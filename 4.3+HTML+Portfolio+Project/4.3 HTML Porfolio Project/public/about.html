<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! My name is Natalie Medrano and I am from Brownsville, Texasü§†. I am 20
  years old and a recent graduate from devCodeCamp's 14-week Full-Stack Software
  Developer course. During the 4 month intense course at devCodeCamp, I
  discovered a true passion for coding, especially coming up with a design for
  the front end. I love how such a small idea can turn into something so
  magnificent and helpful. In college, I was a nursing major, however after
  working in the medical field as a Medical Assistant for a couple of months, I
  realized that was not my true passion and what I was meant to do in life. I
  really wanted a career in which I could not only challenge myself but also
  grow my knowledge and grow who I am as a person. With devCodeCamp, I truly
  discovered a passion for coding and know that there is still so much room for
  learning and growth to be made which makes me extremely excited.I'm ready and
  thrilled to keep expanding my skills and learning more about designing the
  front end of websites, I truly feel so happy knowing I am going into a career
  that I loveüòÅ.
